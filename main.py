# Welcome to the Database Tracker! Here we will start by introducing ourselves, calculate discount amount and discounted price for a product on sale, and fixing the bugs for a popular nursery rhyme!

# Here is our main method for our program, where Python starts reading our code and executing commands
if __name__ == "__main__":
  ## Part A ##
  # String: assign a variable called (name) to your name
  # Integer: assign a variable called (grade) to your grade level
  # Float: assign a variable called (weeks) to the value 5.0
  
  # Here you are introducing yourself with a print statement and concatenation with a (+) sign to connect strings, integers, and floats together
  # Note that the variables (grade) and (weeks) are enclosed in str(). We use str() to typecast integers and floats to a string data type. This is crucial so that this print statement can be executed and the computer can read in your information.
  print("Hello everyone! My name is " + name + " and I am in " + str(grade) + "th grade. I am a Data Programming student in the " + str(weeks) + " weeks long Explorer
  Program!")
  
  ## Part B ##
  # Price of Product 
  price: 1.30
  
  # Discount Percentage
  discount_percentage: 50.0 
  
  # Discount Amount
  discount_amount: 0
  
  # Discounted Price
  discounted_price: 0
  
  # Formula to Calculate Price for a Product on Sale
  # Discount Amount = (Discount Percentage x Price)/100
  # Discounted Price = Price - Discount Amount
  
  # Replace the formula with the variables indicated above for Part B and assign to variables called (discount_amount) and (discounted_price)
  #
  #
  
  # Use print statements to print out the discount amount and the discounted price
  #
  #
  
  ## Part C ##
  q = # Replace this comment with the escape sequence for a quote
  
  # Use your knowledge of escape sequences to fix the bugs that occur when this code segment is run
  # Replace quotation marks in this nursery rhyme with the variable (q) to print quotation marks without errors in the code!

# Betty Botter Rhyme
# Betty Botter bought a bit of butter;
# “But,” she said, “this butter’s bitter!
# If I put it in my batter
# It will make my batter bitter.
# But a bit o’ better butter
# Will make my batter better.”

# Then she bought a bit o’ butter
# Better than the bitter butter,
# Made her bitter batter better.
# So ’twas better Betty Botter
# Bought a bit o’ better butter.
